I created a two player battleship game. 

The game is played on a 5x5 grid and each player has five ships that consist of one cell. 
The game is played until one player runs out of ships. 
The spinoff is if you hit the opposing playerâ€™s ship then you get to shoot again! 
At the end of the game, the stats between the first and second player are displayed for the user. 

I orginally wrote the game in C where you can find the source code here:
